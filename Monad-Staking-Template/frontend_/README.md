# Monad Staking Frontend

Next.js frontend for the Monad Testnet staking demo client.

## Network
- Chain: Monad Testnet
- Chain ID: `10143`
- RPC: `https://testnet-rpc.monad.xyz`
- Explorer: `https://testnet.monadvision.com`

## Integrated Contracts
- Staking Contract: `0x05e5Fd41B82A368f5E3c158200996a9E42deF869`
- Staking Token: `0x534b2f3A21130d7a60830c2Df862319e593943A3`
- Reward Token: `0x40D419F6aE98cF4726825f59718dc2cDB4F43bf5`

## Features
- Wallet connect 
- Monad network switch/add in wallet
- Read staking state (`owner`, `duration`, `finishAt`, `rewardRate`, `totalSupply`)
- User actions: approve+stake, withdraw, claim rewards
- Owner actions: set duration, fund rewards, notify reward amount

## Run
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Cricket API Setup
Cricket sportsbook uses CricAPI via a server route.

Create `.env.local`:
```bash
CRICAPI_KEY=your_cricapi_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_TREASURY_ADDRESS=0xyour_admin_wallet
NEXT_PUBLIC_PVP_WAGER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xyour_pvp_escrow_contract
```

Without this key, `/sports/cricket` will render but live match list will stay empty with an error hint.

## Game Transactions
- Single-player (`/games/mines`, `/games/apex`):
  - On loss, stake amount is transferred from player wallet to `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_TREASURY_ADDRESS`.
- Multiplayer NFT (`/games/nft-card`):
  - Both players connect wallet.
  - Creator creates on-chain stake, opponent joins with same stake.
  - After match result, both vote winner on-chain.
  - Winner claims total pot from escrow contract.
